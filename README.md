# 🏥 Healthcare Data Analysis


## Overview
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) on healthcare data to uncover patterns in patient outcomes and risk factors. Bridges **biochemistry** background with **data analytics**.


## Questions
- What features correlate with outcome X?
- Which patient segments have higher risk?
- Can simple rules/thresholds flag potential outliers?


## Workflow
1. Import & inspect (Pandas)
2. Clean (nulls, types, duplicates)
3. EDA (distributions, correlations, groupby)
4. Visualize (Matplotlib)


## Files
- `analysis.ipynb` – Step‑by‑step notebook
- `healthcare_dataset.csv` – (anonymized/sample)
- `images/plots.png` – Key charts


## Results (fill after running)
- Feature **A** moderately correlates with outcome (**r = …**)
- Group **B** shows higher **metric C**


## Tech
Python • Pandas • Matplotlib • (Optional) SQL
